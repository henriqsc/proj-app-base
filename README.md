# Sample application deployment using Azure AKS
#### In this repository you will find a basic script to deploy a sample application on the Azure cloud native Kubernetes service (AKS).

#### The sample application was cloned from [denilsonbonatti](https://github.com/denilsonbonatti/k8s-projeto1-app-base) and consists of a PHP backend, MYSQL database and a front-end that can be ran locally.

#### USAGE:

1. Git clone the repository
2. Edit and run deploy_az.sh
3. Edit the frontend js.js file inserting the server IP (in this case the azure load balancer) and run index.html on your local machine.
